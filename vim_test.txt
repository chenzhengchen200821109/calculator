***--    For the first time, Apple has admitted to slowing some IPhones down.  But the company explained it only took the action last year to prevent battery-related shutdowns.  Apple's action -- and the company's decision to keep it secret - led to widespread criticism from industry analysts and iPhone owners.  Owners of iPhones in several states are suing Apple.  They accuse Apple of violating fraud laws by purposely limiting performance without informing iPhone owners that the problems might have been fixed by replacing the device battery.
